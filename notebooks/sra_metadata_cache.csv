SRR12068547,Mesoplasma florum,Transcriptome profiling of Mesoplasma florum strain L1 using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and genome-wide 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE),"Mesoplasma florum is a near-minimal bacterium belonging to the Mollicutes class particularly characterized by its small genome, fast growth rate, and lack of pathogenic potential. Here, we report the first genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of this microorganism using directional RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE). 5'-RACE sequencing reads were used to identify 605 putative transcription start sites (TSSs), of which more than 400 could be associated to a conserved promoter sequence. Along with terminator predictions, these TSSs allowed the reconstruction of M. florum transcription units, covering more than 90% of annotated genes. We evaluated the expression level of all M. florum protein coding genes using paired-end RNA-Seq reads according to the number of fragments per kilobase per million of mapped reads (FPKM). FPKM values were converted to absolute transcript abundances using biomass quantification data. These efforts aim at reaching a deep understanding of global cellular mechanisms in M. florum and will guide future genome engineering projects in this simple organism. Overall design: One 5'-RACE replicate and a total of six RNA-Seq replicates (three biological replicates, each processed in technical duplicate) performed on log-phase M. florum cultures growing in ATCC 1161 medium.",PRJNA641121,SAMN15341344,RNA-Seq,TRANSCRIPTOMIC,cDNA,PAIRED,ILLUMINA,8044840,804484000,2020-11-03 18:44:06

SRR19619612,Piscinibacter sakaiensis,"RNA-seq of Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 when grown on PET, TPA·2Na, and EG","Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)-degrading bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis produces hydrolytic enzymes that convert PET, via mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), into the monomeric compounds, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Understanding PET metabolism is critical if this bacterium is to be engineered for bioremediation and biorecycling. TPA uptake and catabolism in I. sakaiensis have previously been studied, but EG metabolism remains largely unexplored despite its importance. First, we identified two alcohol dehydrogenases (IsPedE and IsPedH) and one aldehyde dehydrogenase (IsPedI) in I. sakaiensis as the homologs of EG metabolic enzymes in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. IsPedE and IsPedH exhibited EG dehydrogenase activities with Ca2+ and a rare earth element (REE) Pr3+, respectively. We further found an upregulated dehydrogenase gene when the bacterium was grown on EG, whose gene product (IsXoxF) displays a minor EG dehydrogenase activity with Pr3+. IsPedE displayed a similar level of activity toward various alcohols. In contrast, IsPedH was more active toward small alcohols, whereas IsXoxF was the opposite. Structural analysis with homology models revealed that IsXoxF had a larger catalytic pocket than IsPedE and IsPedH, which could accommodate relatively bulkier substrates. Pr3+ regulated the protein expression of IsPedE negatively; IsPedH and IsXoxF were positively regulated. Taken together, these results indicated that the combination of IsPedH and IsXoxF complements the function of IsPedE in the presence of REEs. IsPedI exhibited dehydrogenase activity toward various aldehydes with the highest activity toward glycolaldehyde (GAD). This study demonstrated a unique alcohol oxidation pathway of I. sakaiensis, which could be efficient in EG utilization.
