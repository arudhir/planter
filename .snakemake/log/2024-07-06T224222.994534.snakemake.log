MissingOutputException in rule download_reads in file /home/ubuntu/transXpress2/workflow/rules/illumina.smk, line 3:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
outputs/illumina/raw/SRR2103848_second5k_1.fastq.gz (missing locally, parent dir contents: reads)
outputs/illumina/raw/SRR2103848_second5k_2.fastq.gz (missing locally, parent dir contents: reads)
Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
